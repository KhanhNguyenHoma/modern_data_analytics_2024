### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation**

**Step 1.1: Collect Data**
- **AED Locations:** Gather data on the current locations of AEDs in Belgium, including longitude and latitude coordinates.
- **Intervention Locations:** Collect data on past medical interventions, specifically their longitude and latitude coordinates.

**Step 1.2: Data Cleaning and Validation**
- Ensure that all collected data is accurate and complete. Remove any duplicates or erroneous entries. Verify that coordinates are within the expected range for Belgium.

**Example:** If a dataset lists an intervention at `[4.35247, 50.84673]` (Brussels), ensure that this location is valid and not a data entry error.

### 2. **Analysis and Initial Calculation**

**Step 2.1: Calculate Current Minimum Distances**
- For each intervention location, calculate the distance to the closest AED. You can use the Haversine formula for distance calculation between two latitude and longitude points.

**Step 2.2: Sum of Minimum Distances**
- Sum all the minimum distances calculated in the previous step. This sum represents the baseline objective function that we aim to minimize.

**Example:** If there are two interventions, one 0.5 km away from the nearest AED and another 0.3 km away, the sum of minimum distances is 0.8 km.

### 3. **Optimization Process**

**Step 3.1: Create a Grid Over Belgium**
- Overlay a grid on the map of Belgium. The granularity of the grid can be adjusted based on the desired precision and computational resources.

**Step 3.2: Simulation and Objective Function Calculation**
- For each grid point, simulate the addition of an AED at that location. Recalculate the sum of the minimum distances between intervention locations and their closest AED (including the newly added one).
- The objective function to minimize is the sum of these minimum distances.

**Step 3.3: Iterative Addition Based on Budget**
- If there's a specific number of AEDs to be added, iterate the process by adding AEDs one by one to the locations that yield the most significant reduction in the objective function.

**Step 3.4: Brute Force and Heuristic Approaches**
- Consider using a brute force approach if computational resources allow, otherwise, employ heuristic methods to find a good enough solution.

**Example:** If adding an AED at grid point `[4.49970, 50.69513]` reduces the sum of minimum distances the most, that location is chosen for the next AED.

### 4. **Visualization and Reporting**

**Step 4.1: Visual Representation**
- Create a map visualization showing existing AED locations, past intervention locations, and proposed new AED locations.
- Optionally, use color coding or symbols to differentiate between existing and proposed AED locations.

**Step 4.2: Generate Reports**
- Prepare a report summarizing the findings, including the reduction in the objective function, locations of new AEDs, and any patterns observed in the intervention data.

**Example:** A map with dots representing interventions, stars for current AEDs, and circles for proposed AED locations.

### 5. **Review and Adjustments**

**Step 5.1: Sensitivity Analysis**
- Conduct sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changing grid granularity or the number of AEDs added.

**Step 5.2: Stakeholder Feedback**
- Present initial findings to stakeholders for feedback and adjust the plan accordingly.

### Summary

This structured approach provides a systematic way to optimize AED placement based on historical intervention data, with a focus on minimizing the distance to the nearest AED. Through iterative simulation and optimization, alongside visualizations and reporting, stakeholders can make informed decisions to improve emergency medical response times across Belgium.
